# TanStack React Table v1 (alpha)

> What happened to v8? Because we are now scoping npm releases to @tanstack, we've decided to rewrite from scratch in TypeScript, we're starting fresh at a v1.0.0 release on the new tagged npm package name.

This is an **alpha** version of React Table v1. It is not ready for production use.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-table@alpha
# or
yarn add @tanstack/react-table@alpha
```
